# 100 Days Of Code - Log
First Day was Dec 17th and I'm finally following the rules of 100DaysOfCode.
### Day 23: January 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I spent way too long searching for an alternative to track my learning through this coding journey.  Experimenting with tiddlerwiki for over an hour before going to github.  Then I decided to actually use github the way the challenge intended it to be used.

**Thoughts:** My learning notes are spread over evernote, random html and css files, and my work wiki.

**Resources:** [tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

**Links to work:** Need some of those here.

### Day 24: January 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Setup a github page to show some work.

**Thoughts:** My hope is that using github this way will get me comfortable using git in the terminal(git bash for me.

**Links to work:** [my github page](https://hemme82.github.io/davehemmesch.github.io/)

### Day 25: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning lots about Git from [The Rainbow Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY).

**Thoughts:** I'm still getting confused about working with my repo localing and then pushing the changes up to github.
