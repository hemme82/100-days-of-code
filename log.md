# 100 Days Of Code - Log
First Day was Dec 17th and I'm finally following the rules of 100DaysOfCode.
### Day 23: January 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I spent way too long searching for an alternative to track my learning through this coding journey.  Experimenting with tiddlerwiki for over an hour before going to github.  Then I decided to actually use github the way the challenge intended it to be used.

**Thoughts:** My learning notes are spread over evernote, random html and css files, and my work wiki.

**Resources:** [tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/)

**Links to work:** Need some of those here.
